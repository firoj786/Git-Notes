Firoj Khan Notes

GIT Architecture:

GIT Bash Command:
-----------------------------------------------
We are having several git command to perform operations with Git repository.

Note: We have created Git Repository in github.com

GIT Repo URL: git remote add origin https://github.com/firoj786/GIT-Hub-Notes.git

GIT Bash Command:
---------------------
git help--->It provides frequently used several gir commands.

git help <cmd-name>--> It opens documentation of that particular command.

git init ----------->It is used to create empty repository or re-initialize exsting repo.

git status----->This command will dispalay status of current repository.

Staged Files.
----------------------
Files which are added and they are to commit.
These file names be displayed in green color.

Un-Staged File.
--------------------
Modified files will be displayed here, we need to stage these files to commit.
These file names will be displayed in red color.

Un-Tracked File
----------------------
Newly created files, we need to stage them to commit.
These file names also will be displayd in red color.

git add:- This command is used to add files to staiging area.

          Syntax: git add <file-name>
          Syntax: git --add =============>To all file at a time.

git rm :This command is used to un-stage newly created files.

                  Syntax: git rm --cached <file-name>
                  Syntax: git rm --cached *

git commit: This command is used to commit our changes to git local repository.

                    Syntax: git commit -m 'commit-msg'

Note: When we execute commit command it will consider all the files which are in staging area.

Note: Git local repository will be available in our machine only.

--------To commit our files to remote repository we should execute below commands-------------

1) git remote add <repo-url> (this required only first time).

2) push -u origen mster (this is used to move changes from local to central).

--------------------------------------------------
git reset : It is used to unstage a file.

git checkout : It is used to discard changes done in a file.

                   Syntax : git checkout -- <file-name>
           
           Syntax : git reset HEAD <file-name>  
           
 
COMMAND Practice.
-------------------------
git help
git help <command-name>
git init
git add
git add --a
git commit -m <msg>
git push
git reset HEAD <filename>
git checkout <file-name>
git status

GIT Repo URL: git remote add origin https://github.com/firoj786/GIT-Hub-Notes.git
           
When we make changes to files we need to stage them to commit.

-->To add files(s) to staging area we will use add command.

-->To commit files(s) to local repo we will use xommit use command.

Note: We should provide reason for commit as a message.

-->To publish local commits to central repository we will use push command.

-->Whenever we commit, git will generate commit-id

-->commit ID contains 40 alphanumrics characters

-->From 40 alphanumbric characters it will display first 7 characters to us.

-->To check commit history we will use git log command.
               Syntax : git log

-->In commit logs it will disolay below details.
               
               a) commit-id
               b) author
               c)timestamp
               d)commit msg
               
-->To take existing project from repository to local system we will use git clone command.
                     Syntax: git clone <repo-url>

-->Before making any change to file(s) in local, it is highly recommended to take lastest changes from repository.
   To take latest changes from repository we wll use it pull command.
   
                     Syntax : git pull
       
       Steps:-              
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--> Create Repository in GIT Hub account(Repo URL will be  generated).

--> Create Spring Boot Application in STS IDE.

--> Go to workspace folder where project is Created.

--> In side Project folder open git.

--> Execute git init command.

--> Execute git add --a command.

--> Execute commit command(git commit -m 'msg').

--> Execute remote add command(git rfemote add <repo=url>.

--> Execute push command (git push -u origin master)

GIT Stash
----------------------------------
It is used to record current changes and make working tree clean.
